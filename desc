LIGMABOL: Updated is a unique survival-platformer where you play as a living energy sphere (Bol). The challenge? Survive by conserving movement and collecting essence. Every step matters-too much movement drains your energy, while clever choices keep you alive longer. In this updated version, Bol can now morph by gathering essence, unlocking new abilities to outsmart enemies and adapt to tougher challenges. Players can still use foes to their advantage, bouncing off them to preserve momentum. It's a survival-platformer that rewards creativity, patience, and strategy-now with evolving gameplay that grows alongside you.
